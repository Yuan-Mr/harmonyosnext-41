### 🌟【HarmonyOS Development Treasure Cases Unveiled】So Many Gems Hidden in Official Docs!  

Hello everyone~ While working on a HarmonyOS project recently, I accidentally uncovered a "treasure trove" in the official documentation! It turns out that the official team has long prepared answers to those hair-pulling cross-device adaptation challenges. Today, let's explore these practical cases and learn how to master "develop once, deploy everywhere" step by step! (There's a surprise tip at the end~)  


### 🚀 I. Business Office Application Case (Official Killer Template)  
#### 👉 Case Highlights:  
This template directly solves three critical pain points—sidebar adaptation, column layout switching, and multi-device card arrangement—a solution even Huawei engineers use!  

#### ✨ Practical Skill Breakdown:  
1. **Intelligent Sidebar (Memo Module)**  
```typescript  
// Automatically switch between embedded/floating modes based on screen size  
SideBarContainer(  
  breakPoint === 'lg' ? SideBarContainerType.Embed : SideBarContainerType.Overlay  
)  
```  
📱 Mobile → Floating sidebar | 💻 Tablet → Embedded sidebar, as smooth as Dove chocolate!  

1. **Dynamic Column Black Technology (Calendar Module)**  
```typescript  
// Intelligent single/double column switching  
Navigation.mode = breakPoint === 'sm' ? NavigationMode.Stack : NavigationMode.Split  
```  
Portrait mobile → Single-column stack | Landscape/tablet → Dual-column parallel—this interaction logic gets 101 points!  

1. **Grid Card Magic (Note Summary Page)**  
```typescript  
Grid() {  
  ForEach(notes, item => NoteCard(item))  
}.columnsTemplate('1fr 1fr 1fr') // Three-column self-adaptation  
```  
From mobile to foldable, cards automatically adjust column count—perfectionists will love it!  


### 🎮 II. Banking Finance Application (Hidden Level)  
#### 👉 Case Highlights:  
A model for handling complex financial data display, the official demo shows how to elegantly present digital charts across multiple devices.  

#### 💡 Pro Tips:  
```typescript  
// Yield curve self-adaptation  
LineChart()  
  .aspectRatio(breakPoint === 'sm' ? 1.5 : 2.3)  

// Product list dynamic layout  
GridItem({ span: { xs: 12, sm: 6, md: 4 } })  
```  
Mobile → Vertical arrangement | Tablet → Matrix arrangement, data visualization is off the charts!  


### 🎥 III. Long-Video Application (Player Adaptation Secrets)  
#### 👉 Case Highlights:  
Solves the adaptation challenge of video players, even considering PC mouse hover effects!  

#### 🎬 Practical Code Snippet:  
```typescript  
VideoPlayer()  
  .controlsVisible(hoverStatus || breakPoint === 'sm') // Persistent control bar on mobile  
  .aspectRatio(breakPoint === 'md' ? 16/9 : 21/9)  
```  
Automatically switches aspect ratio for portrait/landscape, adapts danmaku position—experience comparable to major video platforms!  


### 🛠️ IV. Development Cheat Sheet (Hidden Tricks)  
1. **Breakpoint Listening Magic Tool:**  
```typescript  
// Three lines for device detection  
const breakPoint = useBreakpoint()  
const isFoldable = useFoldableState()  
const orientation = useOrientation()  
```  

1. **Multi-Device Debugging Trick:**  
In DevEco Studio, open multiple Previewers, hold Alt+Drag components to view rendering effects at different sizes in real time!  

2. **Pitfall Prevention Guide:**  
Must-have for PC:  
```typescript  
// Hide system title bar  
window.setWindowDecorVisible(false)  
```  


### 🌈 Conclusion  
Do these cases make you feel "enlightened"? In fact, the HarmonyOS docs hide 20+ industry solutions, from smart homes to in-vehicle systems. I recommend searching [One-Develop-Multi-Deploy Examples] on the official website—you're guaranteed to enter a new world!  

Finally, a word of advice: "Reading ten blogs is不如 (no match for) studying one official case in depth." These battle-tested codes are the real "pit avoidance gold medals"! If you discover other treasure cases, feel free to share intelligence in the comments! 🙌
